%1.if you don't have E drive, replace 'E:\' in line 14 by suitable drive name except c drive.
%2.use any identification. we can record multiple times. use different indentification for
%subsequent executions.
%3.you have to speak 6 words, ' Tennis, Golf, Darts, Soccer, Rugby, Chess '. Each
%one after pressing any button(message will be shown in command window).
%4. you will get 2 seconds for each word. start a little later after
%pressing any button, otherwise initial portion of that word won't be
%recorded.
%5.after each execution listen the recorded word using audio player. if not
%recorded properly, run the program again using same identification.
%6.upload group2 file to-- https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DiNYdqoQccmrTOszh2msk_VC_KMfcVFv
