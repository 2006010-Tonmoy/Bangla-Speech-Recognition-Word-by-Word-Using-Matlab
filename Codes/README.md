Dataset for training can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JYogsdMdph9MLHm9Hroc9g6s1351DRrz?usp=sharing

Despite being one of the most widely spoken languages of the world, no significant efforts have been made in Bangla speech recognition. Speech recognition, in particular keyword recognition, is a difficult task especially if the demand is to do so in noisy real-life conditions. So by following the google assistant software we built a banglla speech recognition word by word. Hope this will work
